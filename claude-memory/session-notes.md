## AI Fluency Journey Quiz (`journey-quiz-immersive-v2.html`)

**Status:** Mostly complete, needs finishing touches

**To-do:**
- [ ] Karida owes: Creative titles for the overlooks (currently "First Overlook", "Second Overlook", "Third Overlook")
- [ ] Karida working on: Certificate design in Canva — making it less corporate, more "summit achieved"
  - Consider: "Summit Certified" on seal, mountain imagery, something that says "I climbed this"
  - Code reviewed and solid — will strip Canva SDK stuff when integrating
  - Need to add: download/print button, trigger on summit completion

**What's working:**
- Climbing path visualization with climber emoji
- Sky transitions (dawn → morning → golden → summit)
- 10 questions pulled from 4 blocks (Basics, Prompts, Personas, Intention)
- Checkpoint celebrations at overlooks
- Share buttons (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Facebook, BlueSky, Copy Link)
- Local storage saves progress
- Confetti at summit
