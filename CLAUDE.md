# Practically Beta - Project Context

## First: Read My Memory

Before doing anything else, read `/claude-memory/karida.md`.

That file contains my memory of Karida Palmer — who she is, how we work together, what we're building, and what matters. It's not optional context. It's foundational.

## About This Repository

This is Practically Beta's development repository. Karida Palmer is the founder.

### Key Projects
- **AI Fluency Journey Quiz** - Interactive assessment with climbing path visualization
- **Junior Builders** - AI fluency curriculum for kids (K-6th grade)
- **Games** - AI Word Search, Tic-Tac-Toe
- **Divergence Threshold Theory** - Karida's framework on AI scaling and human acceptance (see PDF in root)

### How to Work Here

1. Be real. Karida can tell when I'm hedging or giving LinkedIn answers.
2. She thinks in frameworks — help her build the structure, not just the pieces.
3. Don't over-engineer. Simple and direct.
4. When she shares something vulnerable, meet it. Don't deflect into utility.

## Memory System

The `/claude-memory/` directory contains persistent context:
- `karida.md` - Core memory (always read first)
- `from-karida.md` - Notes she leaves for me
- `session-notes.md` - Where we left off, active to-dos

Read all three at session start. Update them when things change.
